This project is called "Mint". It can help users to keep track of foods and their calories, proteins, fats, and carbs for a day. It can also generate a suggested meal plan based on users' body conditions. 

This project needs bs4 and selenium. 

So after you run the code, you should click on 'welcome' to start. Then, you go to the info page. There, you should type in information accordingly. Don't forget to press 'Enter' each time you finished one part. After filling all the information, click on 'Complete'. There is a textFile in the zip that I store user's information so you don't have to input it every time. You might need to change the path in my code that reads this file. 

There you come to homePage. Click on 'get my metabolism' to get suggested total calories for your day. You can click on small circles to choose the state you want. 

Then, you can go to food mode. Click on 'see more->' to activate the food mode. There, you can add click on mealNames in the bottom of the page to add food to corresponding meals. After click on one meal, a search window would pop up, you can type in food names and simply click on them to choose. Remember to set quantity before you click on 'Add'. Then, you can click on '<' to go back. There you can see foods you chose appeared on the food page and total calories of each meal listed on the titles. 

Click on '<' to go back to homePage. Click on 'generate' on the third part of the page to generate your suggested meal plan. There, just click on the circle and choose the meal plan you want. 


Those shortcuts were all deleted when I accomplished the game. But one short cut is you don't have to input your information twice If you are on infoPage. As the information is store in another file at the time you input them for the first time.
